    <p>From the graph we are able to see that there is a negative correclation between 
        the median household income per state and the percentage of the population that is obese.<br> 
        The District of Columbia, which has the highest median pay at $46,000, has the lowest
        obesity percentage at 21%. There is one outlier in the dataset which is Peurto Rico. <br>
        Rico, though having the lowest median incomes at $16,669, has an obesity percentage 
        that falls in the middle of the range at 28%.  </p>
